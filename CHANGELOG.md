## [Unreleased]

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING — PHP 8.2 is no longer supported.** `require.php` moves from `^8.2` to `^8.4`.

  **What you must do:** on PHP 8.4 or newer, nothing. On 8.2, either upgrade PHP first or stay on the previous release — it keeps working and is unaffected by this.

- **BREAKING — Laravel 11 and 12 are no longer supported.** The framework requirement narrows from `^11.0 || ^12.0 || ^13.0` to `^13.0`.

  **What you must do:** on Laravel 13, nothing. On 11 or 12, stay on the previous release until you upgrade the framework.

- CI now tests PHP 8.4 with Laravel 13 only, instead of a matrix spanning versions this package no longer claims to support. A matrix that tests what the manifest forbids is worse than none — it reports green for a combination nobody can install.

### Why

These are the kit 0.5 platform floors. The suite was split across PHP 8.2 and 8.3 with the framework spanning 11–13, so no package could rely on anything newer than its weakest sibling. Every PHP package in the kit takes the same floors at once, so a consumer never has to resolve a mix.

Pre-1.0, so this lands in a MINOR. **No API changed, nothing was removed, nothing was renamed** — only what the package requires.


## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-05

### Added

- **render:** emit node className as a class attribute
- fancy-cms — PHP CssEmitter (dual-emitter mirror) + PageRenderer + ServiceProvider (Phase 0+1)
